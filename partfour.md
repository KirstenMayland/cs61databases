Original plan was to create a front-end on my already existing website (kirstenmayland.me); however, after nearly 4 hours of attempting to connect my database to my website and encountering countless errors (a few detailed below), I gave up and decided to just host it on the local host

2 hr general researching and fiddling around with html and php

+ 30-45 min on XAMPP (also threw an error)

^ another hour of errors later, I gave up
