Original plan was to create a front-end on my already existing website (kirstenmayland.me); however, after nearly 4 hours of attempting to connect my database to my website and encountering countless errors (a few detailed below), I gave up and decided to just host it on the local host.

2 hr general researching and fiddling around with html and php

+ 30-45 min on XAMPP (also threw an error)

^ another hour of errors later, I gave up


FINALLY 4.5 hrs in, got XAMPP to work

^ got it to work for the local host (yay!) so I thought I could just convert the idea over to my website. No, did not work, it just downloaded it :/


Now that I have gotten the local host into a place where I can access my database I can actually plan what I'm trying to do:  
Thoughts-  
1) form to query database based on day + what's being lost; returns two values: the cumulative losses at that date and the losses in that specific day
