## Process
#### Dataset
The database I am using and analyzing is called "2022 Russia Ukraine War" on Kaggle and is a weekly updated dataset of real Russian war losses (personal and equipment) during the ongoing Russian-Ukrainian war as best as is able to be compiled. The data was downloaded 7/30/2023

[Kraggle Page For Dataset Download](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/piterfm/2022-ukraine-russian-war?select=russia_losses_equipment_correction.csv)

The dataset can also be found in the zip file, "archive.zip".

#### Example Questions
1) Is there a correlation between POW's taken and losses of aircrafts, helicopters, or tanks?
2) Does the amount of personal loss sustained vary with the seasons e.g. summer more losses than winter?
3) Which day in the war so far has resulted in the greatest loss in Russian lives?
4) Did the type of equipment taking the most losses change from the first month to this last month?
