Final Project
### Overview
#### Dataset
The database I am using and analyzing is called "2022 Russia Ukraine War" on Kaggle and is a weekly updated dataset of real Russian war losses (personal and equipment) during the ongoing Russian-Ukrainian war as best as is able to be compiled. The data was downloaded 7/30/2023

### Reflections
This was a very fun foray into the world of databases and I gained a lot of knowledge in all aspects of the project, but I would say my greatest takeaway from the project was learning about how frontends and backends connect as that was always a point of confusion for me. For most of my career, I've worked in backend, so this opportunity to
