Final Project
## Overview
#### Dataset
The database I am using and analyzing is called "2022 Russia Ukraine War" on Kaggle and is a weekly updated dataset of real Russian war losses (personal and equipment) during the ongoing Russian-Ukrainian war as best as is able to be compiled. The data was downloaded 7/30/2023

[Kraggle Page For Dataset Download](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/piterfm/2022-ukraine-russian-war?select=russia_losses_equipment_correction.csv)

The dataset can also be found in the zip file, "archive.zip".

#### Questions The Dataset Is Capable Of Answering
1) Is there a correlation between POW's taken and losses of aircrafts, helicopters, or tanks?
2) Does the amount of personal loss sustained vary with the seasons e.g. summer more losses than winter?
3) Which day in the war so far has resulted in the greatest loss in Russian lives?
4) Did the type of equipment taking the most losses change from the first month to this last month?

#### Process
1) Designed the database as detailed here: [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md)

3) Imported the data and implemented the database as detailed here: [IMPLEMENTATION.md](IMPLEMENTATION.md)
4) Queried the database and analyzed the data as detailed here: [ANALYSIS.md](ANALYSIS.md)
5) Built a frontend for the database as detailed here: [FRONTEND.md](FRONTEND.md)
