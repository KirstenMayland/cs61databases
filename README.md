Final Project
### Overview
#### Dataset
The database I am using and analyzing is called "2022 Russia Ukraine War" on Kaggle and is a weekly updated dataset of real Russian war losses (personal and equipment) during the ongoing Russian-Ukrainian war as best as is able to be compiled. The data was downloaded 7/30/2023

#### Questions The Dataset Is Capable Of Answering
1) Is there a correlation between POW's taken and losses of aircrafts, helicopters, or tanks?
2) Does the amount of personal loss sustained vary with the seasons e.g. summer more losses than winter?
3) Which day in the war so far has resulted in the greatest loss in Russian lives?
4) Did the type of equipment taking the most losses change from the first month to this last month?

### Installation/Setup Instructions

### Reflections
This was a very fun foray into the world of databases and I gained a lot of knowledge in all aspects of the project, but I would say my greatest takeaway from the project was learning about how frontends and backends connect as that was always a point of confusion for me. For most of my career, I've worked in backend, so this opportunity to
